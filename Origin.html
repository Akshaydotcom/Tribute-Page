	<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 col-md-4"><p id="para1">Jay Garrick, The guy you see in the awesome albeit a simple costume is the first character to take up the mantle of the Flash.
	He first appeared in 1940, in the comic The Flash issue 1, which was published by All American Comics. He was a high-school student who was in a chemistry lab, one day when he accidently inhaled heavy water vapours, as a result of which 
	he could move at supersonic speeds and he had super fast reflexes. He added to his father's helmet wings, to make it different, thus symbolizing hope and also the greek god Hermes. If anyone is thinking how did he keep his identity secret, 
	he just moved his head and supersonic speed, so his head looked like a blurred photo, thus protecting his identity. He now acts as a mentor to other speedsters.

		<p id="para2" style="margin:-20px;">My Favorite Flash of all time, Barry Allen. The guy is a CSI: Crime Scene Investigator, for the Central City Police Department, and that's his day job. Although he was known to be very slow and constantly late with his work, he was a brilliant scientist.
		One day while at work, he was struck with lightning and due to that shock, he was douzed in some chemicals and this, understandably, put him in a coma. Once he was up, he discovered that he was granted superspeed and super-reflexes. This iteration of the Flash has been the most successful, and
		has been credited of bringing the silver age of superheroes to their prime. He is also one of the founding members of the Justice League, and due to his ability to think and perceive within an attosecond, he has been known to rival the mental capabilities of Batman and Superman. There are some
		storylines, where the lightning blast that hit him, was actually himself from the future. Yeah, the dude can time-travel just by running. Along with super-speed, he also has a deadly punch in his arsenal known as the infinite mass punch. To pull off an infinite mass punch, he runs around the earth, until 
		he is at his max speed, which is atleast tens of hundreds of times faster than the speed of light and punches his opponent.
